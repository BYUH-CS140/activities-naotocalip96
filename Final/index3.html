      <p>
        Baptism is the first ordinance of the gospel and a sacred covenant with God. Through baptism, we show our willingness to follow Jesus Christ and become part of His church.
      </p>
      <p>
        Baptism washes away our sins, helps us start fresh, and opens the way to receive the Holy Ghost.

        <em>“... as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, ... what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?”<br>
        — Mosiah 18:8, 10, Book of Mormon</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Baptism is a joyful step on the path to becoming more like Jesus Christ.
