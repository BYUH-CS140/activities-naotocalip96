            Feeling out of place is something that many people experience during the process of growing up. Sandra Cisneros' “Eleven” and Amy Tan's “Fish Cheeks” depict this feeling of loneliness. In both stories, children are troubled by the differences between their culture and their surroundings and are torn between their identity and society's expectations. In “Eleven,” the children experience a difficult time at school, while in “Fish Cheeks,” they are embarrassed by cultural differences at family meals. Both stories show how society makes children feel ashamed of their own culture.

            In Sandra Cisneros' Eleven, a girl named Rachel feels sad and helpless when her teacher mistakes her owning an old red sweater. The story conveys the loneliness and distress of feeling “different” at school without explicitly describing her culture. Rachel shows that she still feels like a child and that adults and friends do not understand her by saying, " What they don't understand about birthdays and what they never tell you is that when you're eleven, you're also ten, and nine, and eight.” The red sweater represents embarrassment and being forced to wear something that does not belong to you. Cisneros successfully expresses the feeling of loneliness through a child's perspective and gentle language.

            In Fish Cheeks, Amy Tan shares a memory of having Christmas dinner with an American boy and finding Chinese culture embarrassing. When she saw the fish eyes and tofu, she wondered uneasily, "What would Robert think of such a Chinese Christmas?” This shows her desire to conform to American culture and her embarrassment about her own culture. But in the end, her mother tells her to value her own culture. This story reminds us that we don't have to hide who we are. Tan tells us that cultural differences not only cause vexation, but also lead to growth and self-confidence.

            “Eleven“ and ”Fish Cheeks" both depict children who feel lonely because of cultural differences, but in different ways. In “Eleven,” Rachel is humiliated at school and feels sad. The tone of the story is quiet and heavy. In “Fish Cheeks,” the protagonist is embarrassed at a family dinner, but her mother's words help her to value her culture. There is also a bit of humor. Rachel remains painful to the end, but Tan's protagonist finds relief and becomes more positive. Both stories convey the feelings of a child suffering from being different.

            In conclusion, in Sandra Cisneros' “Eleven” and Amy Tan's “Fish Cheeks,” the young protagonists are experiencing cultural embarrassment and loneliness as they contemplate how to align their identities with society's expectations. Rachel is shamed at school, while Tan's protagonist is embarrassed at a family dinner.

            Both of these stories depict the difficulty of accepting one's culture when it feels hard. Cisneros emphasizes the loneliness of school, while Tan shows a more hopeful perspective through the support of her family. Both stories show us that although cultural differences can be uncomfortable, they can also lead to self-awareness and pride. These stories make us think about how we can accept ourselves while still conforming to society's expectations.
